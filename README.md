Data correlation is when two metrics are strongly linked to each other and follow up on each other in a linear line. A correlation can be positive or negative. When a correlation is positive there is an increase of value.
This is a very basic project involving Correlation Data Analysis and a second one in a Data Analyst Portfolio.
A dataset consisting of payment and value of care details is downloaded from Kaggle and imported into jupyter Notebook and the analysis is done using Python. 
Correlation is found using a plot of scatter chart and a heatmap.
